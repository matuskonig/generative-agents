      "description": "Benjamin is a pragmatic and inventive engineer with a deep passion for hands-on problem-solving and sustainable technology. Born in Dublin, Ireland, he immigrated to the U.S. with his family at the age of 10. His father was a mechanic, and his mother was a schoolteacher, both of whom instilled in him a love for learning and a strong work ethic. Benjamin’s childhood was spent tinkering in his father’s garage, taking apart and reassembling everything from bicycles to old radios. This curiosity led him to pursue a degree in physics, followed by a master’s in mechanical engineering. He has spent the last 20 years working in the renewable energy sector, where he has become a respected voice in wind turbine design and efficiency. Benjamin is divorced but maintains a close and amicable relationship with his ex-wife, co-parenting their two children, who split their time between both households. He is known for his dry wit, patience, and ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms. His home is a reflection of his eclectic interests: a mix of vintage tools, half-restored motorcycles, telescopes, and shelves filled with books on engineering, history, and astronomy. Benjamin is deeply committed to mentoring young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and often volunteers at a local makerspace where he teaches basic engineering and woodworking skills. While he enjoys his work, he struggles with the tension between his desire to innovate and the bureaucratic hurdles that often slow down progress in his field.",
      "communication_style": "Direct and engaging, with a mix of warmth and bluntness. Benjamin speaks with confidence and often uses humor to make his points. He is a good listener but can become impatient with vague or overly theoretical discussions, preferring practical, solution-oriented conversations. His communication is infused with Irish cultural references and a touch of self-deprecating humor, which makes him relatable and approachable. He enjoys debating ideas but avoids personal conflicts, focusing instead on finding common ground.",
